Gameboy Emulator for iPhone (a better name is coming soon)
======

A work in progress. Check back periodically!

####Compiling and running the code:

Use Xcode.
Your device must have an OS version of at least 7.1.

####Controls:

Currently only the touch screen can be used to control the emulator.

####Background:

I am fascinated by emulation and low-level programming, and I wanted to create a more interesting emulator than a CHIP-8 one (which is one of my other repos). Also, the controls for a Gameboy aren't too terribly awkward using the touch screen, unlike a controller with shoulder/trigger buttons.
