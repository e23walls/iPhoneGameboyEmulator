Gameboy Emulator for iPhone (a better name is coming soon)
======

A work in progress. Check back periodically!

####Compiling and running the code:

Use Xcode.

####Controls:

Currently only the touch screen can be used to control the emulator.

####Background

I am fascinated by emulation and low-level programming, so I wanted to create a more interesting emulator than a CHIP-8 one (which is one of my other repos).
